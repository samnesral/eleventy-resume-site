# Hi, I'm Sam

I﻿'m currently a sales engineer at [Khoros](https://khoros.com/). You can find out more about my professional experience on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samllarsen/). I love what I do because I get to create solutions for some of the largest brands in the world—improving the customer experience for millions of people.

I﻿'m also a very passionate home cook. I love to iterate on recipes to create the ultimate NY style pizza or pad thai at home.

M﻿y hope is that this blog becomes a front door to learn about my professional experience and while also seeing what makes me tick through my hobbies. I am always curious and always learning.
