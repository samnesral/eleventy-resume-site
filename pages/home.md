![picture of sam](/static/img/img_0839.jpeg#avatar)I'm Sam, a sales engineer at [Vanta](https://vanta.com/). You can find out more about my professional experience on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samllarsen/). I love what I do because I get to help secure the internet and help business earn and prove trust.

I'm also a very passionate home cook. I love to iterate on recipes to create the ultimate NY style pizza or pad thai.

I hope this blog can be a place where I document interesting things I've learned, whether that's a new piece of technology at work or a new way to make German lye pretzels. If you'd like to get in touch, use the [contact page](/contact).
