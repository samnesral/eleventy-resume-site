![picture of sam](/static/img/img_0839.jpeg)I'm Sam, currently a sales engineer at [Khoros](https://khoros.com/). You can find out more about my professional experience on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samllarsen/). I love what I do because I get to create solutions for some of the largest brands in the world—improving the customer experience for millions of people.

I﻿'m also a very passionate home cook. I love to iterate on recipes to create the ultimate NY style pizza or pad thai at home.

I hope that this blog can be a place where I document interesting things I've learned, whether that's an interesting new piece of technology at work or a way to make german lye pretzels. If you'd like to get in touch there's a [contact page](/contact).
