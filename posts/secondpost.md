This recipe is a concept I call "braised and glazed". This means you braise chicken thighs in a sweet and savory braising liquid and once it's tender and cooked through you reduce the braising liquid into a sticky glaze. I firmly believe that you should cook chicken thighs until they are done and then cook them some more, ideally to 190-200Â°F. At this temp they become soft and sticky and are such a great compliment to this sweet, savory and tangy glaze.
